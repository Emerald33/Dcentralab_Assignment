    "Description": "Binance Coin (BNB) is the native token of Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20) and Binance Chain (BEP-2). Originally launched in 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB is now used for all operations in the Binance ecosystem. Binance Coin was launched with an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, where half of BNB’s strict maximum of 200 million tokens were offered to the public. The rest were distributed between angel investors and founding members. The coin was created as a utility token for discounted trading fees, but its uses have since expanded to numerous functions, both in and outside of the Binance ecosystem. The Binance ecosystem is powered by BNB, as such, BNB is the native coin to the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Both chains operate in parallel and due to their similar designs, they can natively communicate with each other. Binance Chain is a simple design in terms of its application – the main goal is to facilitate fast trading while being able to handle large amounts of traffic. The most popular DApp on the Binance Chain is Binance DEX. BSC extends this functionality by adding the ability to create smart contracts and more complex DApps. Binance Smart Chain was created as a hard fork of the Go Ethereum (Geth) protocol, the two chains, therefore, have many similarities and BSC remains compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It was created to provide faster and cheaper transactions. BSC achieved this by using a different consensus mechanism. Ethereum’s Proof of Work (PoW) consensus is similar to Bitcoin’s, whereas BSC uses Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). To help maintain the value of BNB, Binance holds periodic burning events. Every quarter, Binance uses 20% of its profits to repurchase and then burn BNB, meaning it is permanently destroyed. Binance will continue these burns until it reaches 50% of the initial supply, bringing the total to 100 million. This process helps BNB to sustain its value by making the coin finite and scarce. Binance Coin is available to buy directly on the Binance exchange where it offers most options in terms of trading pairs with BNB. The original exchange also offers the best trading rates for BNB. BNB's current price is $690.06, it has dropped -1.02% over the past 24 hours. BNB's All Time High (ATH) of $792.88 was reached on 4 Dec 2024, and is currently -13% down. The current circulating supply of BNB is 145.89 Million tokens, and the maximum supply of BNB is 145.89 Million. BNB’s 24 hour trading volume is $844.05 Million. It is traded on 140 markets and 59 exchanges, the most active of which is Binance. BNB's current share of the entire cryptocurrency market is 2.90%, with a market capitalization of $100.67 Billion."

    "Description": "Solana is a high-performance layer1 blockchain that achieves scalability through parallel processing. It is a scalable, decentralized, and programmable blockchain that facilitates transactions of its native SOL coin as well as digital assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and SPL tokens. Solana's founder, Anatoly Yakovenko, created the project in 2017 intending to increase the scalability of a cryptocurrency blockchain without sacrificing decentralization or security. One of Solana's key features is its high transaction speed, supporting up to 50,000 transactions per second without sharding. The blockchain uses a proof of stake consensus mechanism along with timestamped transactions, known as Proof of History, to achieve this scalability. SOL also serves as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on future upgrades and governance proposals. Solana is used for various applications including decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) markets. The blockchain runs on its own consensus mechanism combining Proof of History and Proof of Stake, providing almost instant finality for transactions. Solana's current price is $194.33 with a market capitalization of $93.99B and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.40B."
